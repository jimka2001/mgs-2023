\section{Objectives}


There are several objectives of this course:
\begin{description}
\item[Mathematics:] Ameliorate your love for Mathematics.
\item[Computer Science:] Develop a sense programming.
\item[Communication:] Confidently defend your ideas.
\end{description}

Why math?  We assume that you as a student already loves math, and we
will use examples in abstract math as source of ideas to write
computer programs.


The mathematical and computer science topics have been chosen for this
course complement each other.  You will enforce what you've learned by
writing computer programs using the ideas and also by explaining to
your peers what it is that you have done.


It is important that the leaders of tomorrow, especially the leaders
in the technology sector, understand the impact on humans of
technological development.  We must know how to apply abstract
concepts to real computation problems, and how to explain their ideas
and defend their decisions to their peers.

Don't forget that you are working not only with machines but also with
humans.  In this course, we will maintain a respectful, inclusive, and
safe environment.  Remember that different people have different
strengths and weaknesses.  Scientific discussions can sometimes become
heated and experts might disagree about the best course of action.
We will keep disagreements objective and use science to test
ideas, rather than relying on emotions.

Good ideas that are never explained die and are forgotten.  It is my
belief that you don't understand something until you can explain it.
From time to time, some students will present their solutions to their
peers.  This means defending your choices, recognizing strengths and
shortcomings, and being subjected to peer review (important in the
scientific process).  This exercise is intended not only to learn to
accept constructive criticism but also to build confidence.

\section{Note from your Instructor}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{jimka-porto}
\end{figure}
I'm Dr. Jim Newton and I will be your instructor and coach for two
weeks as explore mathematical applications in functional programming.

I am a Mississippi native, and a graduate of Mississippi State
University where in 1988 I received a BS in Electrical Engineering and
in 1992 an MA in Mathematics.  Years later, in 2015, I received my PhD in
Computer Science from Sorbonne University in Paris, France.  I
currently live in Issy les Moulineaux, France, and work as an
assistant professor and researcher at EPITA (\url{www.epita.fr}), a
French engineering school

In 1981, I was a scholar at the first ever Mississippi Governor's
School.  I've designed this course remembering my own experience at
MGS, back in the day. I realize that different students coming from
different high schools in Mississippi have been exposed to various
levels of mathematics and computer science courses. I nevertheless
hope that regardless of your background and previous experience, you
will find this course interesting and challenging.  I am confident that
if you apply yourself and remain self-confident, you will succeed and
learn a lot.

\section{Overview}



We will probably proceed through several units which mix three important experiences:

\begin{itemize}
\item Theory --- Learn mathematics and computer science concepts.
\item Practice --- Create code relating to the theory of various units.
\item Presentation --- Show and explain what you have done.
\end{itemize}

We will primarily cover an introduction to Abstract Algebra.  Our
practical treatment of Algebra will help you prepare for a more
theoretical treatment at the university level.

\section{GitHub}

In this course we will be experimenting with software together.   You will be able to
share your code with your classmates, and with the world.  However, you control
when you want to make your code available to the world, and when you want to
incorporate your classmate's code into your development area.


\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{GitHub-How-to-use-GitHub-Edureka-300x241.png}

  \caption{GitHub is a cloud service which hosts code repositories.
    You connect to GitHub either by web browser or directly from
    \emph{git}.}
\end{figure}




To achieve this goal we have a central repository of code, hosted by
GitHub on the cloud.  You will download (clone) a copy of this repository,
edit existing code, and create new code, and then occasionally upload your
contributions back to the central repository, making your
contributions available to everyone else.

GitHub is a web based service which hosts thousands of projects, small and large, in the cloud.
Typically, users have a development environment on their local computer
(laptop or desktop) and periodically upload and download changes to
the cloud.

The URL \url{https://github.com/jimka2001/mgs-2023}, is the public
entry point to the GitHub project which we will work on in this
MGS-2023 course.
How we will edit code in the GitHub project is described in Section~\ref{sec.gitpod}.

You must create an account on GitHub (if you don't have one already).  This will be done
in Section~\ref{sec.setup}.


\section{GitPod}\label{sec.gitpod}

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{GitPod provides a web-brower-based development environment
    which integrates with GitHub.}
\end{figure}

We will use a development environment entirely on the cloud---
a web based service called, GitPod to provide an
environment for working with GitHub.  This environment and all the
code you develop will still be available to you after MGS-2023 is
finished.

The GitPod web site is \url{https://www.gitpod.io}.


\section{Getting Started}
\label{sec.setup}

It may be a bit tedious to set up the development environment, because
before you can learn to use a piece of software, you have to install
it; necessarily you are installing things you don't yet understand.
The following steps should help, but often things go wrong with
set-up, so we'll troubleshoot as we go.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a GitHub account using an abstract user name.  Don't use
  your real name.  This URL,
  \url{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration}
  explains how to create a GitHub account.  There are many similar
  web-sites, e.g.,
  \url{https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub}.
  Primarily this is self explanatory at the URL
  \url{https://github.com/join}.
\item (Optional) Configure your GitHub account with an profile image.  Don't use
  a picture of yourself, rather use an abstract avatar
  such as \url{https://www.flaticon.com/search?word=animal+avatar}.
\item Open \url{https://github.com/jimka2001/mgs-2023} with your web browser.



\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{fork-repo.png}
\caption{GitHub Fork}\label{fig.github.fork}
\end{figure}

\item Fork the repository. See Figure~\ref{fig.github.fork}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
  
\caption{Prepend to URL in browser{hello.py}}\label{lab.prepend-gitpod}
\end{figure}


\item Open the web-IDE, GitPod. You may just prepend
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{prepend-gitpod.png}
  to the URL in the web browser.

\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{explorer.png}
\caption{Opening \code{hello.py}}\label{lab.explorer}
\end{figure}

\item Find the Explorer.  Open it to find \code{hello.py} at
  \url{src/hello/hello.py}. See Figure~\ref{lab.explorer}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{hello-function.png}
\caption{The editor pane of the \code{hello} function.}\label{lab.hello}

\item Click \code{hello.py} to open the file in an editor pane.  You
  should see something like that shown in Figure~\ref{lab.hello}.


\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{hello-terminal-output.png}

\chapter{Mathematical Sets and Functions}
\begin{figure}[b!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{math.jpg}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

In this unit we will look at functions both from a mathematical
perspective and also from a programming perspective.  There are some
important similarities and some important differences.


We would like to talk about functions.  But where should we start the conversation?

You may already have some intuition about functions.  Sometimes
functions have names, like $\sin$, $\cos$, and $\log$.  Sometimes
functions lack names but have formulas such as
$\frac{x^2-1}{x^2+2x+1}$.



\section{Set Operations}

We avoid the problem of defining exactly what a set is, cf. Russell's paradox.
We will instead concentrate on operations we can perform on sets.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Venn-A-intersect-B.png}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item is-element-of: $x\in A$
\item is-subset-of: $A\subset B$
\item empty-set: $\emptyset$
\item union: $A\cup B$
\item intersection: $A\cap B$
\item complement: $A\setminus B$ or $\overline{B}$
\item De Morgan's theorem: $\overline{A\cup B} = \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}$, or dually $\overline{A\cap B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Functions}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth]{Function_machine2.png}
\end{figure}



What is a function? A function such as
\[f : X \to Y\]
is a correspondence between two sets.  But it is a special
correspondence.  In particular the function,~$f$, associates a unique,
well-determined, element of~$Y$ with each element of~$X$.
More precisely, if $x\in X$, then~$f(x)$ designates a unique,
well-determined, element of~$Y$.
\[x \in X \implies f(x) \in Y\,.\]

  \caption{A function is a well-defined correspondence of all the elements of one set
    (the domain) with some of the elements of another set (the range).}
\end{figure}




Conceptually, a function has three parts
\begin{enumerate}
\item A \emph{domain}, i.e., a place from which input values may be taken.
\item A \emph{range}, i.e., places where output values are found.
\item A \emph{rule}, i.e., a way of determining the output value given only the input value.
\end{enumerate}





\section{Mathematical notation}

\begin{align}
  f(x) &= 3x + 1 \label{eq.simple.1}
\end{align}


Let's start with a very simple function~\eqref{eq.simple.1}.
Actually, the only thing specified here is the rule.  This function is
written in a mathematical notation where the domain and range are not
specified.  The same notation can be used for different choices of
domain and range.  For example, this function works for integers,
$\mathbb{Z}$, as input, but it will also work for natural numbers,
$\mathbb{N}$, rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$, real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$,
complex numbers, $\mathbb{C}$.  The same function will also work for
matrices or for functions themselves.


If we want to be more precise, we can use a more descriptive notation as in~\eqref{eq.simple.2}

\begin{align}
  f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}~\text{by}~ f(x) &= 3x + 1 \label{eq.simple.2}
\end{align}


The domain and range of a function need not be the same, and need not
be a set of simple numbers.  For example, we use the symbol
$\mathbb{R}^2$ to denote the set of ordered pairs of real numbers;
i.e.,
\[\mathbb{R}^2 = \{(x,y)\mid x\in \mathbb{R} \wedge y\in\mathbb{R}\}\,.\]
Equation~\eqref{eq.simple.3} shows an example of such a function.

\begin{align}
  f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}~\text{by}~ f(x,y) &= 3x - 2y + 1 \label{eq.simple.3}
\end{align}

Mathematical notation such as $a+b$, $a\times b$, $a-b$, $a^3$, and
$\frac{x^2-1}{x^2+2x+1}$, but we may also specify
functions using cases, like in Equation~\eqref{eq.simple.4}


\begin{equation}\label{eq.simple.4}
  |x| = \begin{cases}
    x &\,; \text{if $x>0$}\\
    0 &\,; \text{if $x=0$}\\
    -x &\,; \text{if $x<0$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\section{What a function is not}

A correspondence which associates multipliple elements of $B$ with
each element of $A$ is not a function from $A$ to $B$.  However the
range of a function (or the domain for that matter) may be any set,
for example we may talk about set-valued functions like a function
whose value for each input is some subset of a given set.

Consider the function which takes a finite set as input, and outputs
the size of the set, \ie, the number of elements in the set.

Consider the function that takes a whole number, $n$, as input and returns
the set of integers between $0$ and $n$ as output.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{function.png}
  \caption{Example of something that is not a function}
\end{figure}

A function must also be well-defined.  I.e, the value of the function
for a given input must be a fixed value.  The value may be difficult
to compute, or perhaps even unknown, but it must be some particular
value.  A function cannot, for example, return a random integer for
each input.


\section{Functions: Programmatic Representation}

To implement a function in the Python programming language we:
\begin{itemize}
\item specify the function name, such as \code{square}
\item specify zero or more input parameters, such as \code{(x)}
\item compute output value: \code{return x*x}
\item follow the correct syntax
\end{itemize}

Input values come from the \emph{domain};  output values
come from the \emph{range}.

\begin{verbatim}
  def square(x):
    return x * x
\end{verbatim}




\section{Specifying functions by recurrence}
\label{sec.recurrence}

Functions can be defined in terms of themselves.  We might use an intuitive definition
such as Equation~\eqref{eq.simple.5}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq.simple.5}
x^n = \underbrace{x \times x \times \ldots \times x}_{n~\text{times}}\,.
\end{equation}

We can define the same function more explicitly by using recursion as
in Equation~\eqref{eq.slow.exponent}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq.slow.exponent}
  x^n = \begin{cases}
    1 &\,; \text{if $n=0$}\\
    x \times x^{n-1} &\,; \text{if $n > 0$}\\
    \frac{1}{x^{-n}} &\,; \text{if $n < 0$ and $x\ne 0$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}


Similarly, we can define the factorial as
\begin{equation}\label{eq.intuitive.factorial}
  n! = 1 \times 2 \times \ldots \times n
\end{equation}

or we can define it as
\begin{equation}
  n! = \begin{cases}
    1 &\,; \text{if $n=0$}\\
    n \times (n-1)! &\,; \text{if $n > 0$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The first case need not be $n=0$.  We can define the Fibonacci
numbers.  Let $F(n)$ denote the n'th Fibonacci number.


\begin{equation}
  F(n) = \begin{cases}
    1 &\,; \text{if $n=1$}\\
    1 &\,; \text{if $n=2$}\\
    F(n-1) + F(n-2)  &\,; \text{if $n > 2$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[b!]

\section{Programming constructs}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Conditionals

\item Functions

\item Variables

\item Collections: lists, sets, tuples
  
\end{enumerate}



\section{Implement the Quadratic Formula}\label{sec.quadratic.formula}

As a first program in Scala you will implement the quadratic formula.
recall that if
\[ax^2 + bx + c = 0\,,a\ne 0\]
then 
\[x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\,.\]

\begin{itemize}
\item Implement the function \code{quadraticFormula}.
  The function should implement the mathematical
  function $x_{1,2}(a,b,c) = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.  The function computes the roots
  of the polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c$, assuming $a>0$, and assuming $b^2 \geq 4ac$.


\item Enhance \code{quadraticFormula}: Notice that the current
  implementation is inefficient, because it computes almost the same
  thing twice.

\item What happens if $ax^2 + bx + c$ does not have real roots? If you
  call the function with \code{a,b,c} what is returned?
  
  You should refactor the function to define a variable
  \code{discriminant} whose value is
  \[\Delta = b^2 - 4 a c\,.\]
  Then there are three cases, if ${\Delta < 0}$, if ${\Delta = 0}$, and
  if ${\Delta > 0}$.  Refactor the function so that if there are no
  real roots it returns an empty list; if there is a unique 
  solution, return a list of one number; and if there are two
  distinct solutions, return a list of those two solutions
  \textbf{in increasing order}.  \Ie, if you return \code{[a,b]}
  assure that $a < b$.  Also update the test case to check for
  $a<b$.
\end{itemize}


\section{Recursive Functions}
\label{sec.recursive.functions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement \code{power}.  You should also handle the case of a
  negative exponent.
\item Implement \code{String} concatenation using the power model.
\item Implement \code{List} concatenation using the power model.
  \item Implement \code{factorial}. 
\end{itemize}
  
\textbf{Discussion:} In the \code{factorial} function, do we
  need a case for $n=0$ and also $n=1$?  How does this relate to the
  principle of induction?  Look up \emph{Principle of Induction} if
  you need to review it.


\section{Fibonacci Sequence}
\label{sec.fibonacci.numbers}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement a recursive function such that given $n$, the function
  returns the nth Fibonacci number, $F_n$.
\item Analyze the recursive profile of the Fibonacci generator?
\item Suppose that one recursive call requires $m$ bytes, and your computer has a total of $M$ bytes of memory,
  can you find a bound for the maximum Fibonacci which is possible to compute?
\item Can we use memoization to make the Fibonacci generator faster?
\item We may compute compute any three
  consecutive Fibonacci numbers: $F_{n-1}$, $F_{n}$, and $F_{n+1}$,
  \[\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}^n = \begin{bmatrix}F_{n+1}&F_n\\F_n&F_{n-1}\end{bmatrix}\]
  How can we implement such a multiplication in Python?  Hints:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item How can we represent a $2\times 2$ programmatically?
  \item How can we multiply two matrices?
  \item How can we compute  $\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}^n$ with approximately $\log_2 n$ matrix multiplications?
  \end{enumerate}
  
\item Search on the internet and find the Binet's formula for
  computing the nth Fibonacci number.  Implement this function and
  compare the results to the recursive implementation.  

\item \textbf{Making code faster} Now you have a way which you suspect
  is more efficient (faster).  Devise an experiment to determine which
  of the approaches is faster in terms of execution time?  Hint, you
  may need to contstruct a loop to do the same computation 100 times
  or 1000 times, and the divide the total time by 100 or 1000 to
  compute the average time per computation.

\end{itemize}

\section{Binary Search}
\label{sec.binary.search}

A binary search algorithm is a divide an conquer algorithm.  Suppose
we know that some \emph{event} occurs at a number between $x_{left}$
and $x_{right}$.  For example, suppose $f(x) = 0$ for some
$x_{left} < x < x_{right}$.  Then if we take $x_{mid} = \frac{x_{left} + x_{right}}{2}$, then
at least one of the following is true.

\begin{align}
  f(x) & = 0 & \text{ for some } x_{left} < x \leq x_{mid}\\
  f(x) & = 0 & \text{ for some }  x_{mid} < x < x_{right}
\end{align}

This means if we split the interval $(x_{left},x_{right})$ in half,
the \emph{event} occurs either in the left half or the right half.
In such a case, we can write a (recursive) function which divides the
interval in half, and \emph{recurs} either on the right half or left half.
We end the recursion when we have found the event.

If we don't find the exact value we are searching for, then we must have a
termination condition to avoid looping forever.  Typically the way this is
done is to recur until the interval is sufficiently small:  i.e., until
${x_{right} - x_{left} < \varepsilon}$.

\section{Roots of a Cubic Polynomial}

Can we combine the technique of Sections~\ref{sec.recursive.functions}
and ~\ref{sec.binary.search} to find the roots of a cubic equation?

\chapter{Logic and Looping}

\section{Logic}

\begin{definition}[proposition]
  A \emph{proposition} is a logical statement which has a truth value of true or false.
\end{definition}

For example, let $p$ be the proposition: Light travels at 300,000 km/s
in free space; and let $q$ be the proposition: the atomic number of
carbon is 33.

We may ask: is $p$ true.  The answer is, yes.  Likewise, we may ask: is
$q$ true.  The answer is, no.

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{predicate} is a proposition valued function.  We talk about
  the predicate being true in the case that the proposition which it
  outputs is true.
\end{definition}





Examples of predicates are \emph{prime(x)}, or \emph{x > 42}.  For
each of these, given an input value, we derive a proposition, then we
can ask whether that proposition is true or false.  Given the
predicate $prime(x)$ and given the value 13, we construct the
proposition: 13 is prime; then we may as whether that proposition is
true. Given the value 15, we may as: Is 15 prime?  Given the value
-12, we may ask: Is -12 greater than 42?

For example, let $g(n)$ be the predicate $n is prime$.  Now we may ask
$g(13)$ and $g(15)$.  $g(13)$ is true while $g(15)$ is false.
Similarly if $h(n)$ is the predicate $n>42$, then we may ask $h(-12)$
and get false.

Given two propositions, we may combine them by conjunction.  The
resulting proposition is true if and only if both of the original
propositions are true.  \Eg, Proposition $p$: Light travels at 300,000
km/s in free space. Proposition $q$: The atomic number of carbon is 33.
Since $p$ true, and $q$ is false, the
proposition \emph{conjoining} the two, $p\wedge q$, is consequently false.

Likewise, predicates can be conjoined (or intersected).  If we can
compute whether given an integer $n$, whether it is prime, and we can
also compute whether it is greater than 42, we can therefore compute
whether it is prime and greater than 42.

$(g\wedge h)(n)$ is true if $g(n) \wedge h(n)$.


Disjunction is the dual of conjunction.  The disjunction of two
propositions is true if either of the original propositions is true.
For example, given $p$ and $q$ as above, the disjunction $p\vee q$ is
true because at least one of $p$ and $q$ is true.

Similarly given an integer, $n$, we can decide whether it is prime and
greater than 42, by testing both predicates and combining the output
by disjunction.

If a predicate is true, its logical negative is false. If a predicate
is false, then its logical negative is true.  The if $p$ is a
predicate then either $p$ is true or $\neg p$ is true.


We may combine set mechanics and predicates with something called a \emph{set comprehension}.
\[\{m\in\N \mid m > 42\}\]

The idea is that we take the subset of some set ($\N$ in this case) by
taking all the elements of that set which satisfy a given predicate.

\section{Implication}

If proposition $q$ is true whenever $p$ is true then we can say that
$p$ implies $q$, or $p\implies q$.  Note that $p\implies q$ does not
say anything about what happens if $p$ is false.

An implication is yet again a proposition, and like any proposition it may be true or false.  For example the following is a false implication:  ${n\in \Z \implies n>1}$. However, the following implication is true: ${n\in N \implies n= 0 \vee n\geq 1}$.


\section{Quantifiers}

\[\forall x \in N, n > -1\]

\[\exists x \in N, n > 42\]



\section{De Morgan's theorem}

We saw De Morgan's theorem for sets already.  But logic and set theory
are duals, so De Morgan's theorm can also be stated for propositions
and predicates.

\[\neg \jparen{p(x) \vee q(x)} = \neg p(x) \wedge \neq q(x)\]

\[\neg \jparen{p(x) \wedge q(x)} = \neg p(x) \vee \neq q(x)\]

We may apply De Morgan's theorm to quantifiers

\[\jparen{\forall x \in N, p(n)} = \neg \jparen{\exists x \in \N, \neg p(n)}\]
\[\neg \jparen{\forall x \in N, p(n)} = \jparen{\exists x \in \N, \neg p(n)}\]

\[ \jparen{\exists x \in N, p(n)} = \neg \jparen{\forall x \in \N, \neg p(n)}\]
\[\neq \jparen{\exists x \in N, p(n)} = \jparen{\forall x \in \N, \neg p(n)}\]



\section{Looping}

Three very common styles of loops are

\begin{itemize}
\item loop for detection
\item loop for collection
\item loop for side-effect
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Loop for detection}

\code{any}, \code{all}, \code{next}

How does De Morgan's theorem apply to \code{any} and \code{all}?

What does \code{next} do when it does not find an element matching the predicate?

\subsection{Loop for collection}

List comprehensions.

\subsection{Loop for side-effect}

\code{for}

\subsection{Concentric loops}

\section{Programming Projects}



\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose one challenge:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Collect all prime
    numbers between $n$ and $m$.
  \item Collect all Pythagorean triples between 1 and $n$.
  \item Find (print or collect) all solutions to
    $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 1$ for $a,b,c$ in range
    of $-n$ to $n$.
  \item Taxi cab numbers: For a given $n$, find numbers between
    $-n$ and $n$ which are
    the sum of two cubes in two different ways.  E.g., $1729 = 12^3 +
    1^3 = 9^3 + 10^3$.
  \item Linear Diophantine Equations: Given integers $a$, $b$, $c$,
    and $n$, find all integer solutions ($|x|<n$ and $|y|<n$) to
    the equation $ax + by = c$.  \Eg,
    $2x + 4y = 28$ has $x=12$, $y=1$ as solution but also $x=2$, $y=6$.
  \end{enumerate}
  
\item Work as team.
\item Create a new file in the \code{looping} directory.
\item Try to solve the challenge using \code{any}, \code{all}, \code{next}, \code{for}.
\item (Optional) If possible, can you make it faster? \Eg, decrease the search space.

In Section~\ref{sec.quadratic.formula}, you worked with a function
which computes the (real) roots of a second-degree (quadratic)
polynomial given only its coefficients.  There is an analogous formula
to compute the roots of a cubic (degree-3) polynomial, and still
another to compute the roots of a degree-4 polynomial.  Is there
such formula for a polynomial of degree 5 (quintic) or higher?


The question of whether such a formula exists for the quintic had been
an open question for 250 years until Niels Henrik Abel proved its
non-existence in 1823 at the age of 21.



%%By https://www.parismuseescollections.paris.fr/fr/petit-palais/oeuvres/combat-devant-l-hotel-de-ville-le-28-juillet-1830, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1280931

Around the same time a young, 20 year old, political activist of
post-revolutionary France, Evariste Galois, attempted to explain why
some higher-order polynomials are \emph{solvable in terms of radicals}
and others are not.  I use the word \emph{attempted} not to imply that
his explanation was wrong.  To the contrary, his ideas were correct
but nobody understood his treatment of the subject.  An example of his
writing is shown in Figure~\ref{fig.galois.hand}.  One well-respected
mathematician of the time, Joseph Fourier, took home a sizable work of
Galois to digest it but unfortunately died unexpectedly, and the work
was nearly lost.

The story of Evariste Galois who quickly wrote down the principles of
abstract algebra before his death as a result of a duel, is depicted
in several YouTube videos: notably \emph{Evariste Galois a
documentary} \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6dsanpnpt0} and
\emph{Galois Theory Explained Simply}
\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct2fyigNgPY}, both produced by
Math Visualized.


It is not surprising that mathematicians did not understand the work
of Galois during his sort lifetime.  Figure~\ref{fig.galois.hand}
shows an example of his handwriting.

\label{fig.galois.hand}
\end{figure}

In this unit we will study sets with mathematical structure.  This
approach to \emph{abstract algebra} is of course much cleaner than
that introduced by Galois.  Galois somewhat flippantly introduced the
\emph{group} and the \emph{field} just as a tool to talk about the
solvability of a polynomial, probably without realizing that they
deserve in-depth study themselves.

There are several mathematical structures defined by axioms.  We will
thereafter write programs as individuals and as teams to manipulate
these structures.

\section{Monoid}
\label{sec.monoid}
\begin{definition}[Monoid]
$(S,\circ)$ is called a \emph{monoid} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item Closure: $a,b \in S \implies a\circ b \in S$.
\item Associative: $a,b,c \in S \implies (a\circ b) \circ c = a \circ (b \circ c)$
\item Identity: $\exists e\in S$ such that $a\in S \implies a\circ e = e\circ a = a$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent Notice that we assume that a monoid has an identity element, but we
don't assume that it is unique.  Can a monoid have more than one
identity element: $e_1$ and $e_2$?  The answer is no, but why?  

\begin{theorem}\label{th.identity.unique}
  The identity of a monoid is unique.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $e_1$ and $e_2$ are both identities of monoid, $M$.
  Since $e_1$ is an identity, then $e_1e_2=e_2$.  But since $e_2$ is an identity,
  then $e_1e_2 = e_1$. Thus
  \[e_1 = e_1e_2 = e_2\]
\end{proof}

\section{Examples of monoids}

\item $(\mathbb{N},+)$, the set of natural numbers under addition is a monoid.

\item The set of integers under exponentiation is not monoid. Why? Which axiom(s) fail?

\item ${(\mathbb{R},\times)}$, the set of positive real numbers under multiplication is a monoid.

\item The set of $2\times 3$ matrices under addition is a monoid.  

\item The set of $2\times 3$ matrices under multiplication is not a monoid.  However the set of $3\times 3$  matrices under multiplication is a monoid. Why? 


\item The set of logical predicates.  What is the identity element?
  
\item The set of subsets of a given set using the operation of union is a monoid.  What is the identity element?
\item The set of subsets of a given set using the operation of intersection is a monoid.  What is the identity element?

\item Let $\Sigma$ be any set of distinguishable elements: ${\Sigma = \{a,b,c,d\}}$.
  Now consider the set, ${\mathcal{L}(\Sigma)}$, of all sequences of finite length
  $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ for which $x_i \in \Sigma$ for $i=1, 2, \ldots, n$, $n\ge 0$.
  I.e., ${\mathcal{L}(\Sigma)}$ includes all sequences
  of length 12, and all sequences of length 54, and all sequences of length 10,051, etc.

  Let $+$ denote sequence concatenation.  E.g.,
  \[(a,c,a,a) + (d,a,c,a,b) = (a,c,a,a,d,a,c,a,b)\,.\]
  ${\mathcal{L}(\Sigma)}$ is a monoid.

  What is its identity element?

  Is it a commutative monoid?

\section{Fast Exponentiation in a Monoid}
\label{sec.monoid.exponent}
Recall the definition of exponentiation in
Equation~\eqref{eq.slow.exponent}.  In any monoid with operation $\circ$ and identity
element $e$, we can compute an
integer power of an element more efficiently according to the
following formula.



\begin{equation}
  x^n = \begin{cases}
    e &\,; \text{if $n=0$}\\
    x &\,; \text{if $n=1$}\\
    x \circ x^{n-1} &\,; \text{if $n$ is odd}\\
    (x^\frac{n}{2})\circ     (x^\frac{n}{2}) &\,; \text{if $n$ is even}\\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}\label{eq.fast.exponent}

If the monoid is also group, then inverse elements exist, so we can
talk about \emph{negative} exponents in the sense that $x^{-n} =
(x^{-1})^n = (x^n)^{-1}$, in which case we can compute positive and
negative powers efficiently.  Either we compute $x^{|n|}$ and then
compute its inverse, or we can compute $x^{-1}$ and then raise that to
the power of $|n|$.

\begin{equation}
  x^n = \begin{cases}
    e &\,; \text{if $n=0$}\\
    x &\,; \text{if $n=1$}\\
    x \circ x^{n-1} &\,; \text{if $n>0$ is odd}\\
    (x^\frac{n}{2})\circ     (x^\frac{n}{2}) &\,; \text{if $n>0$ is even}\\
    (x^{-1})^{|n|} &\,; \text{if $n<0$}\\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}\label{eq.fast.exponent.group}



\textbf{Discussion:} What must you do to allow negative exponents?  Is
it possible for a monoid?  Which algebraic structure is necessary to
support negative exponents?




\section{Proofs with Monoids}
\begin{itemize}
\item Prove the identity of a monoid is unique
\item Give an example of a 2 element monoid.
\item Given an example of a 3 element monoid.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Groups, Rings, and Fields}

\section{Group}

A notable property missing from a monoid is the ability solve equations.  As an example,
take the 12-clock above.  Which of these equations can be solved in the integers?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Solve for $a$ in $a\times 3 = 7$.
\item Solve for $b$ in $4\times b = 8$.
\item Solve for $c$ in $7\times c = 11$.
\end{enumerate}

We observe that some such equations have unique solutions, such as
$4\times b = 8 \implies b=2$. However, to systematically solve such an
equation we need to be able to find an inverse with respect to the
operation of the monoid.

\begin{align*}
  a\times 3 &= 7\\
  a\times 3 \times 3^{-1} &= 7 \times 3^{-1}\\
\end{align*}

But there is no integer, $3^{-1}\in\mathbb{Z}$, such that $1 = 3 \times 3^{-1}$.
However, some monoids do have the property that every element is
invertible. A monoid for which every element has a unique inverse is
called a group.  Essential to the idea of inverse is that an inverse
be unique.



\begin{definition}[Group]
$(G,\circ)$ is called a \emph{group} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(G,\circ)$ is a monoid.
\item Inverse: $\forall a\in G~\exists a^{-1}\in G$ such that $a\circ a^{-1} = a^{-1} \circ a = e$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Abelian Group]
  If $G$ is a group such that $a\circ b = b\circ a$ for all
  $a,b\in G$, then we call $G$ an \emph{Abelian} group.
\end{definition}



A group has an identity which is also the identity of the monoid,
which we already know to be unique.  See
Theorem~\ref{th.identity.unique}.  But we can ask a similar uniqueness
question about the inverse.  Can an element $a\in S$ have two
different inverses?  No, but why?

\begin{theorem}
  Each element of a group has exactly one inverse.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $G$ be a group with identity $e$. Let $a\in G$ have inverses $x$ and~$y$.
  \begin{align*}
    x &= x\circ e \\
    &= x \circ ( a \circ y)\\
    &= (x \circ  a) \circ y\\
    &= e \circ y\\
    &= y
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}


\section{Examples of groups}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The set of integers, ${\mathbb{Z} = \{0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots\}}$, is a group under
integer addition.   Why?
\begin{itemize}
\item $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ is a monoid with $0$ being the identity.
\item If $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ there exists $b\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $a+b=0$.  E.g.   ${12 + (-12) = 0}$
\end{itemize}

\item The integers under multiplication is not a group.  Why?

\item The set of rotations of the $n\times n$ Rubik's cube is a group.   Every rotation has an inverse rotation, and the null-rotation is the identity.

\item The set of $3\times 3$ matrices of real numbers is not a group.  Why?

\item The set of subsets of a given set using the operation of union is not a group.  Why?
\item The set of subsets of a given set using the operation of intersection is not a group.  Why?
\item The set subsets of a given set, $G$, using
  \[A\circ B = (A\cap  \overline{B}) \cup (\overline{A}\cap B)\]
  as the operation, is a group.  Every element is its own inverse.  The identity element is the empty set, $\emptyset$.



\item Imagine a clock going from 1 to 11, rather than 1 to 12.
  Similar to the clock monoid seen above, here is the multiplication
  table of the strange 11-clock.
  
  \begin{center}
    \small
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
      * & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 \\
      \hline
\hline 1& 1& 2& 3& 4& 5& 6& 7& 8& 9& 10& 11\\
\hline 2& 2& 4& 6& 8& 10& 1& 3& 5& 7& 9& 11\\
\hline 3& 3& 6& 9& 1& 4& 7& 10& 2& 5& 8& 11\\
\hline 4& 4& 8& 1& 5& 9& 2& 6& 10& 3& 7& 11\\
\hline 5& 5& 10& 4& 9& 3& 8& 2& 7& 1& 6& 11\\
\hline 6& 6& 1& 7& 2& 8& 3& 9& 4& 10& 5& 11\\
\hline 7& 7& 3& 10& 6& 2& 9& 5& 1& 8& 4& 11\\
\hline 8& 8& 5& 2& 10& 7& 4& 1& 9& 6& 3& 11\\
\hline 9& 9& 7& 5& 3& 1& 10& 8& 6& 4& 2& 11\\
\hline 10& 10& 9& 8& 7& 6& 5& 4& 3& 2& 1& 11\\
\hline 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11& 11\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

In this example, we see that the set is NOT a multiplicative group,
because the element 11 has no inverse.  


\item Every non-11 element in the table above 
has an inverse.  We can tediously verify the existence of a unique
inverse for every non-11 element.

The set of non-11 elements of the 11-clock is a multiplicative group
with the following multiplication table.

  \begin{center}
    \small
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}

\item In Section~\ref{sec.monoid}, we defined the set
  ${\mathcal{L}(\Sigma)}$ of finite-length sequences using list
  concatenation as the monoid operation.  This set is not a group.
  Why?


\end{enumerate}


\section{Exponentiation in a Group}

Create an exponentiation function for a group which also handles negative exponents.

Why can we compute negative exponents in a group but not in a monoid?
Recall Section~\ref{sec.monoid.exponent}.

\clearpage
\section{Ring}

A monoid and a group are both sets with a single operation for which
the elements of the set interact to obey a set of axioms (the monoid
axioms or the group axioms).  Now we will look at sets with two
operations, which you can na\"ively think of as addition and
multiplication. 

\begin{definition}[Ring]
$(S,+,\times)$ is called a \emph{ring} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(S,+)$ is an Abelian group.
\item $(S,\times)$ is a monoid.
\item Left-to-right distribution: \\$a,b,c  \in S \implies a\times(b+c)=(a\times b)+(a\times c)$.
\item Right-to-left distribution: \\$a,b,c  \in S \implies (b+c)\times a=(b\times a)+(c\times a)$.
\end{enumerate}    

\noindent In the special case that $(S,\times)$ is commutative,
$(S,+,\times)$ is called an Abelian ring.
\end{definition}




In the set of whole numbers we can think of multiplication as repeated
addition.  However, in many cases this does not hold.  For example,
matrix multiplication cannot be expressed simply as repeated matrix
addition.  In fact, in a ring, the only thing that connects the
addition and the multiplication is the distributive axiom.
Multiplication or addition may be defined in strange ways, but if the
ring axioms are satisfied, the ring is valid.

In the integers $0\cdot a = a\cdot 0 = 0$.  Actually this principle,
called \emph{annihilation} is true for rings in general as shown in
Theorem~\ref{th.ring.annihilation}.  Several other familiar
connections between multiplication and addition also hold in general
for rings.  In particular $-1 \cdot -1 = 1$
(Theorem~\ref{th.ring.-1}), and $-1\cdot a = -a$
(Theorem~\ref{th.ring.-a}).

\begin{theorem}\label{th.ring.annihilation}
  For ring, $S$ with additive identity $z$ and multiplicative identity $e$, we have $za = az = z$ for all $a\in S$.
\end{theorem}
Let's denote the additive inverse of any element $x$ by $\overline{x}$
\begin{proof}
  \begin{align*}
    za &= za + z\\
    &= za + (za + \overline{za})\\
    &= (za + za) + \overline{za}\\
    &= (z + z)a  + \overline{za}\\
    &= za  + \overline{za}\\
    &= z
  \end{align*}
  Likewise,
  \begin{align*}
    aa &= az + z\\
    &= az + (az + \overline{az})\\
    &= (az + az) + \overline{az}\\
    &= a(z + z)  + \overline{az}\\
    &= az  + \overline{az}\\
    &= z
  \end{align*}
  
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}\label{th.ring.-1}
  For ring, $S$, with multiplicative identity
  $e$, we have $\overline{e}\cdot\overline{e} = e$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
 Let $z$ be the additive identity of the ring.
  \begin{align*}
    \overline{e}\cdot\overline{e} &= \overline{e}\cdot\overline{e} + z\\
    &= \overline{e}\cdot\overline{e} + (\overline{e} + e)\\
    &= \overline{e}\cdot\overline{e} + (\overline{e}\cdot e + e)\\
    &= (\overline{e}\cdot\overline{e} + \overline{e}\cdot e) + e\\
    &= \overline{e}\cdot(\overline{e} + e) + e\\
    &= \overline{e}z + e\\
    &= z + e & \text{By Theorem~\ref{th.ring.annihilation}}\\
    &=  e 
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{th.ring.-a}
  For ring, $S$, with 
  $e$, we have $\overline{e}\cdot a = \overline{a}$ for all $a\in S$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  \begin{align*}
    \overline{e}\cdot a &=     \overline{e}\cdot a + a + \overline{a}\\
    &=     \overline{e}\cdot a + e\cdot a + \overline{a}\\
    &=     (\overline{e} + e)\cdot a + \overline{a}\\
    &=     z\cdot a + \overline{a}\\
    &=     z + \overline{a} & \text{By Theorem~\ref{th.ring.annihilation}}\\
    &=     \overline{a}
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\section{Examples of rings}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The integers $(\mathbb{Z},+,\times)$ is a ring.
\item The integers $(\mathbb{N},+,\times)$ is not a ring.  Why?
\item The set of $n\times n$ matrices, for a fixed value of $n>0$ is a ring.
\item The set of $2\times 3$ matrices is not a ring.  Why?
\item $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, the set of polynomials with integer
  coefficients such as ${3x^4+2x^2-5x+1}$ is a ring.
\item $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, $\mathbb{R}[x]$, $\mathbb{C}[x]$,
  $(\mathbb{Z}/p)[x]$ for prime $p$. 
\item The set of polynomials with rational coefficients with leading
  coefficient equal to 1 is not a ring.
  ($x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2+ 5x - \frac{2}{3}$)  Why?
\item The set of subsets of a given set using intersection as
  multiplication and exclusive or as addition forms a ring.
\item The set of 8-bit sequences (bytes) consisting of 0 and 1, such
  as 00101101, with the two operations AND and XOR, defined bitwise
  using the following tables is a ring.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|}
      XOR & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
\hline0& 0& 1\\
\hline1& 1& 0\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\quad\quad
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|}
      AND & 0 & 1 \\
      \hline
\hline0& 0& 0\\
\hline1& 0& 1\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
  
For example
\begin{itemize}
\item 00101101 XOR 00110011 = 00011110
\item 00101101 AND 00110011 = 00100001
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\clearpage
\section{Field}

The most complicated structure we will examine is the field.  You can
think of a field as set which is a ring but more than that.  In a ring
you can add, subtract, and multiply.  But in a field you can also
divide with the exception that you cannot divide by zero. 

\begin{definition}[Field]
$(F,+,\times)$ is called a \emph{field} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(F,+, \times)$ is an Abelian Ring.
\item $(F \setminus 0, \times)$ is a (Abelian) group, where $0$ is the identity under $+$.
\end{enumerate}    
\end{definition}


\section{Examples of fields}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$.
\item The set of $n\times n$ matrices is not a field.  Why?
\item The set of $2\times 2$ matrices of the form $\begin{bmatrix}a&-b\\b&a\end{bmatrix}$ where $a,b\in\mathbb{Q}$.
\item The integers modulo $12$.
\item The integers modulo any prime such as $7$.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
      $+$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline0& 0& 1& 2& 3& 4& 5& 6\\
\hline1& 1& 2& 3& 4& 5& 6& 0\\
\hline2& 2& 3& 4& 5& 6& 0& 1\\
\hline3& 3& 4& 5& 6& 0& 1& 2\\
\hline4& 4& 5& 6& 0& 1& 2& 3\\
\hline5& 5& 6& 0& 1& 2& 3& 4\\
\hline6& 6& 0& 1& 2& 3& 4& 5\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\quad\quad
    \begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
      $\times$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0\\
\hline1& 0& 1& 2& 3& 4& 5& 6\\
\hline2& 0& 2& 4& 6& 1& 3& 5\\
\hline3& 0& 3& 6& 2& 5& 1& 4\\
\hline4& 0& 4& 1& 5& 2& 6& 3\\
\hline5& 0& 5& 3& 1& 6& 4& 2\\
\hline6& 0& 6& 5& 4& 3& 2& 1\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

With these addition and multiplication tables we can tediously verify
that
\begin{itemize}
\item $0$ is the additive identity.
\item $1$ is the multiplicative identity.
\item Every element has an additive inverse.
\item Every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.
\item Addition and multiplication are associative.
\item Addition and multiplication are commutative.
\item The distributive property holds.
\end{itemize}

\item The set $\mathbb{Q}\{\sqrt{2}\} = \{a+b\sqrt{2} \mid a,b\in\mathbb{Q}\}$
  is a field.   Moreover, each of the following can be expressed in the same form ${a+b\sqrt{2}}$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $(a_1 + b_1\sqrt{2}) + (a_2 + b_2\sqrt{2})$
  \item $-(a + b\sqrt{2})$
  \item $(a_1 + b_1\sqrt{2}) \times (a_2 + b_2\sqrt{2})$
  \item {\Large $\frac{1}{a + b\sqrt{2}}$}, provided $a,b$ are not both 0.
  \end{itemize}
  In particular
  \begin{align*}
  (a_1 + b_1\sqrt{2}) + (a_2 + b_2\sqrt{2}) &= \underbrace{(a_1+a_2)}_{\in \mathbb{Q}}+\underbrace{(b_1+b_2)}_{\in \mathbb{Q}}\sqrt{2}\\
  -(a + b\sqrt{2}) &= \underbrace{-a}_{\in \mathbb{Q}} + \underbrace{-b}_{\in \mathbb{Q}}\sqrt{2}\\
  (a_1 + b_1\sqrt{2}) \times (a_2 + b_2\sqrt{2}) &= \underbrace{(a_1a_2+2b_1b_2)}_{\in \mathbb{Q}} + \underbrace{(a_1b_2+a_2b_1)}_{\in \mathbb{Q}}\sqrt{2}\\
  \frac{1}{a + b\sqrt{2}} &= \underbrace{\frac{a}{a^2-2b^2}}_{\in \mathbb{Q}} + \underbrace{\frac{-b}{a^2-2b^2}}_{\in \mathbb{Q}}\sqrt{2}
  \end{align*}
  Why do we know $a^2 -2b^2 \ne 0$ and $a+b\sqrt{2} \ne 0$?

\end{enumerate}

\clearpage
\section{Summary of Algebraic Structures}


\begin{enumerate}
\item A \emph{monoid} is a set where we can add.
\item A \emph{group} is a set where we can add and subtract.
\item A \emph{ring} is a set where we can add, subtract, and multiply.
\item A \emph{field} is a set where we can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
\end{enumerate}

For simplicity we omit the formal definition of \emph{semi-ring} which is a
set in which we can add and multiply, but not necessarily subtract and divide.

These summaries are vague.  For example when we say ``add'' in a
monoid, the actual multiplication may be addition, multiplication,
concatenation, or many other operations depending on the actual
monoid.  The distinction between adding and multiplying requires that
both exist, thus they can only be distinguished in a semi-ring.

If a set has both a $1$ and a $0$ then dividing by $0$ does not make
sense.  For example, in a field, we require all non-zero elements to
have and multiplicative inverse even though all elements have an
additive inverse.

\chapter{Coding Exercises}\label{sec.coding.2}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{coding.jpg}
\end{figure}

\section{Compute number of combinations}
Recall the definition
\[{n\choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\,.\]
Write function to compute this quanity two different ways.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute it directly by computing the three factorials and performing
  the integer division.
\item Rather than computing $n!$ directly, express it as a list of
  prime factors.  \Ie,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item implement a function which, given $n$, uses
    recursion to compute and return the list of prime factors of $n$.
  \item Use that function to implement a function which, given $n$, returns
    the prime factors of $n!$.
  \item Effectively perform the division by
    removing all the prime factors in the denominator, $k!(n-k)!$, from
    those of the denominator, $n!$.
  \item Finally, multiply the remaining
    factors to compute~$n\choose k$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\Eg,
\begin{align*}
  {7\choose 3} &= \frac{7}{3!(7-3)!}\\
  &= \frac{7}{3!~\cdot~4!}\\
  &= \frac{7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2}{(3\cdot 2)(4\cdot 3\cdot 2)}\\  &= \frac{7\cdot \cancel{3}\cdot \cancel{2}
    \cdot 5\cdot \cancel{2\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 2}}{(\cancel{3}\cdot \cancel{2})(\cancel{2\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 2})}\\
  &= 7 \cdot 5\\
  &= 35
\end{align*}

Compare the two functions both in terms of computation time, and also
find values of $n\choose k$ which are computable by one function but
not the other because of integer overflow.

\section{Team Project: Structure Recognition}
\label{sec.team.project.structures}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement functions to detect monoid, group,
  ring, and field given a finite set, and the $+$ and $\cdot$
  operations.
\item When finished with your function, commit, push, and send a
  pull request.
\item To test your code, you will need to pull the changes in the
  repository.
\item Define $\mathbb{Z}/n$, the integers modulo $n$. Is it a
  monoid? Is it a group (Abelian)? etc. \ldots
\item For which values of $n$ is $\mathbb{Z}/n$ a field?
\end{itemize}
  





\section{Group Interactive Project}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement the polynomial ring, with addition,
  subtraction, multiplication.

\item What does it mean for two polynomials to be equal?  For example:
  are these polynomials equal or not?
  \begin{align}
    x^3 - 2x + 1\\
    2x^3 - 4x + 2\\
    -x^3 + 2x - 1
  \end{align}
  Should we consider a polynomial to be the function itself, or should we
  consider it as an equivalence class of all polynomials with the same roots.
  I.e., can we consider \emph{normalized} polynomials such that the leading
  term is 1?
\item Implement \code{polyAlmostEqual}.  Why do we use
  \code{polyAlmostEqual}?  Can we detect whether two polynomials are
  exactly equal?
\item Every odd degree polynomial has a real root.  Can you justify
  this claim?  Write a function which uses a binary search to find
  (estimate) at least one real root of a given odd-degree polynomial.
\item Can you implement \code{polynomialPower} using
  \code{fastPower}.  Is it faster than an iterative implementation?
\item Given a list of roots (perhaps with repeated roots), generate
  the polynomial.  Do this in two ways:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Use the polynomial multiply function written above to expand
    \[(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\ldots(x - r_{n-1})(x - r_n)\,.\]
  \item Generate the expansion directly by sums of products of subsets.
    If \[\Pi_{i=1}^n (x - r_i) = \Sigma_{i=0}^n a_{i}x^{n-i}\,\]
    and if \[S = \{T\in \{r_1\ldots r_n\} \mid~ |T| = n\}\,,\]
    then
    \begin{equation}
      a_k = \begin{cases}
        1 & \,; \text{if $k=0$}\\
        \Sigma_{T\in S}\Pi_{k\in T} k & \,; \text{if $1 \leq k \leq n$}
      \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    
  \end{enumerate}
\item Implement a function to generate a randomly selected polynomial
  of a given degree: \code{randomPoly}.
\end{itemize}



\textbf{Discussion:} Is the set of polynomials of degree $n$ with
integer coefficients an infinite
set or finite set?  Is this set closed under addition?  Are
multiplication and addition associative and commutative? Is it
closed under multiplication?  Does this set form a monoid, group,
ring, or field?

How does the answer change if addition and multiplication of
coefficients is done in $\mathbb{Z}/(n+1)$.

How would you generalize to the polynomial ring over a given field?

Consider the set of polynomials of degree $n$ whose scalars are the
field $\mathbb{Z}/p$.  How would you implement addition, subtraction,
and multiplication?

What if arithmetic on not only coefficients but also exponents is
done in $\mathbb{Z}/(n+1)$.

What would you need to do to use the library you've written
\code{isMonoid}, \code{isGroup} etc to test your hypotheses?  How
would you write a program to generate all such polynomials?

\textbf{Discussion:} Is the set of $n\times n$ matrices with
integer content a finite or infinite set?  What if we restrict the
content to $\mathbb{Z}/(n+1)$?  How would you need to change the
matrix manipulation code you've already written to accommodate
arithmetic in $\mathbb{Z}/(n+1)$?
